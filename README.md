# LPC-Speech-Processor
LPC algorithm in JSFX

I recently bought a PO-35 speak - and it's soooo much fun, I decided to investigate how it processes it's speech.

I found a video with the developer:

and it turns out - they used LPC to record and compress the audio - and then then fiddle with the resynthesis (fundemental OSC and formats) to get all the great whacky effect.

so I decided to write my own in reaper - just for fun!
